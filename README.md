# Android-CR-app

INTRODUCTION:
In this lab we created an app which shows the position of an invisible robot. The app operated in such a way that every time you pressed a button (North, South, East or west) it added one to the counter and also it moved in a certain direction north, south, east or west. Since the robot was in a room there was a maximum amount of direction that the robot could travel in. The maximum 
distance that the robot could travel was five rooms high and four rooms in width. 

RESULTS:
The results of our work was that we were able to observe the location of the robot in the room and if the robot was at the edge of the room the button would turn red so as to worn the player that the player knows that he has reached that end of the room. We were also able to use Boolean values so that we could tell the x and y values to stop counting when the Boolean values equalled false and also to change the button color in accordance of the Boolean values.

DISCUSSION:
In this lab we learned a lot about how to connect our classes and also how to use methods that were in another class. We also used a lot of counters and we also learned how to change colors of various items on the screen of the app.
